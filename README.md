Implement HTTP request using NodeJS, Express, MongoDB Atlas

I have used Postman to test the endpoints.
Visual Studio Code as editor.
Screenshots containing the working of the application is also uploaded.

Use: "nodemon index.js" to run the code but before that make sure you install the node modules using "npm install".

There are two end point one for home page and other for menu.
"/home" :: takes you to home page
"/menu" :: list of all items in menu
"/menu/:id" :: specific menu item

Use GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE in postman to implement CRUD operations.
